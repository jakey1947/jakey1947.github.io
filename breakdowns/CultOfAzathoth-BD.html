                    Cult of Azathoth is a roguelike resource management game where the player fights to keep Azathoth asleep by running businesses to fund
                    their various sacrifices.  It was made over the course of a few days as part of the QUT Winter Gamejam 2024 along with a team of 3 freshmen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original scope was to have a few structures for each resource, people, money and sacrifices. and an upgrade system so you could get further each time you play.  
                    We didn't end up implementing an upgrade system due to time constraints though so this is a true roguelike rather than a roguelite like we intended.

                    During this project I took the role of team lead and programmer.  throughout the project I was teaching a group of freshmen the basics of how to use Unity
                    and how to structure a project for long term development, even though it was a short term project.

                    Events are stored as scriptable objects, variables such as Azathoths consciousness and money are stored in scriptable objects as well allowing them to be
                    drag and dropped into the conditions without writing any code. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I took inspiration from how I solved the inventory system for Stygian Descent and I'm quite happy with how it turned out, 
                    we were able to implement multiple events quite quickly, including the initial prompt which allows you to lose the game instantly.

                    why does that 'n' look like a 'h' though?
