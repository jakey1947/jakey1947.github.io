                    Witch Tales was made in a team of 4 as a university project over the course of roughly 10 weeks.  
                    2 to 4 players can play against each other in a tron like battle, 
                    trying to gain points by forcing the other players to run into your players trail.

                    The original scope was to have a few party games similar to how Mario Party works, 
                    but being inexperienced and running into various issues like the Unity input system just not having functions implemented even though they were documented, 
                    we reduced the scope down to a single game mode and focused on polishing it best we could.

                    My role was programming but somehow I ended up doing vfx as well.  I was responsible for implementing the movement, collider generation for the trails, scores, timer and game state.  
                    I also implemented the trails effects which I was pretty happy with.  The other devs pushed to add the extra thick trail line above the dropped particles but if I were to do it again now days I'd
                    just make the particles themselves taller, with long stems or piles of leaves rather than an individual leaf being dropped at a time.
                    There's not much else to say really, it was quite a long time ago.
